# Supabase Functions Fix Summary

## Issue
The architect-bot and welcome-user Supabase functions were failing with 500 errors when invoked.

## Root Cause
The database schema in the actual Supabase instance was different from what was defined in our `schema.sql` file:
- The `messages` table was missing the `channel_id` column
- Functions were trying to insert messages with a `channel_id` field that didn't exist in the actual table

## Solution
1. Updated both functions to match the actual database schema by removing the `channel_id` field from message insertions
2. Deployed the updated functions to the Supabase project
3. Verified that both functions now work correctly

## Changes Made
- Modified `supabase/functions/architect-bot/index.ts` to remove `channel_id` from message insertion
- Modified `supabase/functions/welcome-user/index.ts` to remove `channel_id` from message insertion
- Deployed both functions using `npx supabase functions deploy`

## Testing
Both functions now return successful responses when invoked:
- architect-bot: `{ message: 'System message sent successfully' }`
- welcome-user: `{ message: 'Welcome message sent successfully' }`

## Next Steps
1. Update the `schema.sql` file to match the actual database schema
2. Consider whether to add the `channel_id` column to the messages table or update the schema to match the current implementation
3. Add proper error handling and logging to the functions
4. Set up automated testing for the functions
