# Database Schema Update

## Overview
This document explains the changes made to the database schema to align with the actual database structure in the Supabase instance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Channel-Related Tables
The following tables were removed from the schema as they don't exist in the actual database:
- `channels` table
- `channel_memberships` table

### 2. Modified Messages Table
The `messages` table was modified to remove the `channel_id` column:
- Removed `channel_id UUID REFERENCES channels(id) NOT NULL`
- The actual table only contains: `id`, `user_id`, `content`, `message_type`, and `created_at`

### 3. Removed Channel-Related Indexes
The following indexes were removed as they reference non-existent tables/columns:
- `channels_creator_idx`
- `channels_privacy_idx`
- `channels_created_at_idx`
- `messages_channel_idx`
- `channel_memberships_channel_idx`
- `channel_memberships_user_idx`
- `channel_memberships_role_idx`

### 4. Removed Default Channel Insertion
The statement to create a default "General" channel was removed:
```sql
INSERT INTO channels (name, description, privacy) 
VALUES ('General', 'Main channel for all users', 'public');
```

## Reason for Changes
The Supabase functions were failing because they were trying to reference tables and columns that don't exist in the actual database. By aligning the schema with the actual database structure, we've resolved the issues with the architect-bot and welcome-user functions.

## Impact
- The architect-bot and welcome-user functions now work correctly
- The schema definition now accurately reflects the actual database structure
- Future development will be based on the correct schema

## Next Steps
1. Consider whether to add the channel functionality back into the database
2. If adding channels back, update both the database schema and the application code accordingly
3. Implement proper database migration scripts to manage schema changes
