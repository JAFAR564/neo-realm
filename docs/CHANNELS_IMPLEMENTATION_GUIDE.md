# Channels Implementation Guide

This document outlines how to properly implement the channels functionality in the NeoRealm/Aether platform.

## Overview

The channels functionality adds multi-channel support to the platform, allowing users to participate in different conversation threads for various topics and storylines.

## Database Schema Changes

The channels functionality requires the following database schema changes:

1. **channels** table - Stores channel information
2. **channel_memberships** table - Tracks which users belong to which channels
3. Modified **messages** table - Now includes a `channel_id` foreign key reference

## Migration Steps

### If Running Locally with Docker

1. Ensure Docker Desktop is running
2. Run the migration with:
```bash
cd neo-realm
supabase db reset
```

### If Migrating to Remote Supabase Project

1. Connect to your Supabase project
2. Apply the migration manually through the SQL Editor in the Supabase Dashboard:
   - Go to Database â†’ SQL Editor
   - Run the SQL commands from `supabase/migrations/20250923215145_add_channels_functionality.sql`

The migration will:
- Create the `channels` table
- Add the `channel_id` column to the `messages` table
- Create the `channel_memberships` table
- Create proper indexes for performance
- Create a default "General" channel
- Update existing messages to belong to the "General" channel
- Make `channel_id` a required field

## Frontend Changes

The frontend has been updated to:
- Fetch and display available channels
- Allow users to join/create channels
- Filter messages by channel
- Implement proper error handling when channels functionality is not yet available

## Supabase Functions Updates

The Supabase functions (`architect-bot` and `welcome-user`) have been updated to:
- Work with or without the channels functionality present
- Create the "General" channel if it doesn't exist
- Properly associate system messages with channels

## Error Handling

The API routes now include fallback logic when the channels tables don't exist, ensuring graceful degradation.

## Deployment Notes

1. After applying the database migration, the channels functionality will be fully operational
2. If your Supabase project is deployed, you may need to redeploy the functions after the database schema changes
3. Run: `npx supabase functions deploy architect-bot`
4. Run: `npx supabase functions deploy welcome-user`

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the migration can be rolled back by:
1. Removing the `channel_id` column from the `messages` table
2. Dropping the `channel_memberships` and `channels` tables
3. Reverting the application code changes
