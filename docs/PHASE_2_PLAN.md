## Technical Requirements

### Database Changes
1. Add `channels` table:
   - id (UUID)
   - name (TEXT)
   - description (TEXT)
   - creator_id (UUID)
   - privacy (ENUM: public, private, unlisted)
   - created_at (TIMESTAMP)

2. Modify `messages` table:
   - Add `channel_id` (UUID) foreign key to channels
   - Add `parent_id` (BIGINT) for threaded conversations

3. Add `groups` table:
   - id (UUID)
   - name (TEXT)
   - description (TEXT)
   - creator_id (UUID)
   - privacy (ENUM: public, private, unlisted)
   - created_at (TIMESTAMP)

4. Add `group_members` table:
   - id (UUID)
   - group_id (UUID)
   - user_id (UUID)
   - role (ENUM: member, moderator, admin)
   - joined_at (TIMESTAMP)

5. Modify `profiles` table:
   - Add `subscription_tier` (ENUM: free, premium)
   - Add `current_character_id` (UUID) foreign key to profiles

### API Endpoints
1. Channel management endpoints
2. Group management endpoints
3. Subscription management endpoints
4. Theme management endpoints

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Performance Issues**: Implement pagination and efficient querying for channels and threads
2. **Complexity Overload**: Release features incrementally with user feedback
3. **Monetization Resistance**: Offer compelling premium features that enhance without restricting core experience
4. **Community Management**: Implement robust moderation tools from the start
5. **Scalability**: Design database schema with future growth in mind

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed technical specifications for each feature
2. Set up project management board (GitHub Projects, Trello, etc.)
3. Assign tasks to team members (if applicable)
4. Begin implementation of channels system
5. Schedule regular check-ins to track progress
